# Practical Module Archives 1: Introduction to HTML

[ [Module 1](../module1/) ]

## Brief Description

This serves as a brief overview of my recent work and the output from Module 1, aiming to document and provide learning materials for others.

## Installation

In your learning journey, you will need:
- A Compiler
- XAMPP
- A Browser

## Usage

- You'll need a code editor software; here, I use `Visual Studio Code`, but you can use any other compiler.
- In subsequent learning, you'll heavily use `XAMPP`; you can operate `Apache` for this module.
- A browser to display the output of the code you've created. You can use your favorite default browser.
- You can start running your program by pointing your file to display through the browser or can access `htdocs` and place your file there. Then run `localhost/yourfolder/` in the browser.
## Module 1: Introduction to HTML

### Practice 1

![1.1](../img/module1/module1.1.png)

Here, we learn about the usage of HTML tags, such as html, head, title, body, writing directly in the body, using the br tag to move to a new line, using p for paragraph, trying font styles like bold (b), italic (i), underline (u), and combining them, learning superscript and subscript attributes with their functions, setting word size with font size, changing typography with font face, changing word color with font color, understanding how to use h1-h6 as headings, using the dl, ol, and li tags for bullets and numbering, and practicing turning text into links with a href.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Hello</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Task 1

![1.2](../img/module1/module1.2.png)

A little play with headers, horizontal lines, and a href to direct to a page.

### Bonuses

![1.3](../img/module1/module1.3.png)

Some additional usage in different forms.
