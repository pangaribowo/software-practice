# Web Engineering Practicum Module Guide

[Web](img/ai.jpeg)

This document serves as documentation for the completion of all modules, both practical work and assignments, and is intended for anyone interested in learning the basics of web engineering, covering fundamental structures of HTML, PHP, database integration, as well as an introduction to cookies and sessions, and more as outlined in the chapters below.

Everyone is welcome to fork or clone the repository with the hope of acknowledging the source if used for publication purposes or similar. This module is entirely dedicated to the learning of all individuals who wish to delve into website engineering through structured modules.

## Repository Usage Guidelines

1. The modules consist of 7 sections of practical learning and assignments, and 1 section for integration covering most of the materials combined into one project.
2. For those interested in the final result, you can directly visit the `Integration` section.
3. As a guide, it will be easier if you already have at least mastered the basics of displaying source code to your respective browsers.
4. Please note that in chapters 5-7 when it comes to databases, you need to have at least a basic understanding of `phpmyadmin` to create tables and interact with the data within.

Feel free to use this repository wisely, and it is far from perfect, so there is a need for further development. For collaboration or inquiries, you can contact via [Email](mailto:trustedintelegree@gmail.com).
